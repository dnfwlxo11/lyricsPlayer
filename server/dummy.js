        Just so you can waste my mind \
        Away \
        So, here we go again \
        I wish I had a wealthy friend \

        I swear it\'s not to tax your mind \
        I don\'t say "love" a thousand times \
        A day \
        So, here go the games we\'re playing \
        Woah-oh-oh-oh \
        I\'ll sing you every love song \
        Woah-oh-oh-oh \
        I\'ll take back all I\'ve said wrong \
        Woah-oh-oh-oh \

        I\'m sorry all the countless acts \
        Of love are not just where it\'s at \
        For you \
        Cause any fool can say "I love you" \
        And \

        Woah-oh-oh-oh \

        You wonder if he\'s satisfied \
        Got a feeling he won\'t come around again \
        Oh, no \

        Oh, no, well \
