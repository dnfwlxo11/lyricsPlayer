        I don\'t say "love" a thousand times \
        A day \

        As he asks with all his might for freedom \
        Name your happiness \
        What takes you away and sleep? and is drawing \
        A part of you, in the book of the end of time \
        open the door start walking \
        Don\'t choose a course, just let yourself go \
        If you have a hand, offer it to someone else \
        If you have a heart, teach him what to love \
        It\'s more than a beautiful moment, it\'s like a child \
        Running, screaming in the wind I love you, I love you \
        na nara na na \
        It is the voice that sings to freedom \
        na nara nana \
        It\'s time to speak up and tell the truth \
        na nara nana \
        Give yourself the opportunity to go further \
        Tell me if you remember when it was \
        That last morning that you felt a great desire to live, to live love \
        Tell me if you\'ve been in love \
        And the music has led you to write a song \
        From the depths of your heart \
        That magical moment when your soul becomes one with the universe \
        na nara na na \
        It is the voice that sings to freedom \
        na nara nana \
        It\'s time to speak up and tell the truth \
        na nara nana \
        Give yourself the opportunity to go further \
